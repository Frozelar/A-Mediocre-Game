# A-Mediocre-Game
This is a random stupid platformer that I've started making using C++ and SDL.  It's my first attempt at making a game and I know it's terrible!

So uh, yeah, I'm just a sub-decent programmer who really just uploaded this to github to try and improve at coding.  I really don't know how it's gonna turn out in the end or anything; I'll just try to take it as far as it will go!

Oh yeah, don't steal my code!  I really don't know why the heck you would even want to; I'm sure there's much more worthwhile things out there to embezzle!
